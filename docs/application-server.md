# Application server

The application-server is responsible
for the node "inventory" part of a LoRaWAN infrastructure, handling of received
application payloads and the downlink application payload queue.
This part has been decoupled from LoRa Server.

See [LoRa App Server](http://docs.loraserver.io/lora-app-server/) for more
information.
